// a. require() can be called from anywhere inside the program 
//whereas import() cannot be called conditionally,
// it always runs at the beginning of the file

//b.1) In the package.json file add “type” : “module”. Adding this enables ES6 modules.
//b.2) Another way to do this is by creating a file with .mjs extension. If we are using the file with .mjs extension then we don’t have to add “type”:
// “module” in the package.json file. We can directly write the program and can execute it by typing node –experimental-modules index.mjs in the terminal.
